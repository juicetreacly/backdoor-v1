# README for Secure Shell Command Server
# Overview
This project implements a secure shell command server using Python's socket and ssl libraries. It establishes a secure connection over SSL/TLS and allows the server to execute shell commands sent from a connected client.

# Features
Secure Communication: The server uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data transmitted between the server and client, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
Shell Command Execution: The server can receive and execute shell commands, returning the output to the client.
Interactive Shell: Users can interact with the server by inputting commands through a command-line interface.
Graceful Shutdown: The server can be shut down gracefully with commands such as exit or quit.
Usage
# Requirements
Python 3.x
ssl library (included in the standard library)
A valid SSL certificate (server.pem)
Setup
Install Python: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Generate SSL Certificate (if you don't have one):

# bash
Copy code
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -days 365 -nodes
Run the Server:

Update the HOST and PORT variables in the script as needed.
Execute the script:
# bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Replace your_script_name.py with the name of your Python file.

Connect a Client: Use a compatible client that can connect via SSL/TLS to send commands.

Example
When the server is running, you will see output indicating it is listening for connections. After a client connects, you can type shell commands directly into the server console. The server sends these commands to the client and displays the output received.

Sample Interaction
shell
Copy code
Listening on 192.168.1.5:4444...
Connection from ('192.168.1.10', 54321)
Shell> ls
file1.txt file2.txt
Shell> exit
# Functions
start_server(host, port)
Parameters:
host: The hostname or IP address to bind the server to.
port: The port number to listen on.
Description: Sets up an SSL/TLS server socket that listens for incoming connections. Once a connection is established, it enters an interactive loop where commands can be sent to the connected client.
receive_data(connstream)
Parameters:
connstream: The SSL/TLS wrapped socket connection.
Returns: The received data as a string.
Description: Continuously receives data from the connection until no more data is available. This handles receiving command output from the client.
# Security Considerations
Ensure that your SSL certificate is properly configured to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
Avoid running the server on untrusted networks to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
